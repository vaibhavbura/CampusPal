10.15.5 Teaching Learning 
Process 
ACADEMIC CALENDAR  
1) Academic Calendar is prepared by the Time table committee 
(centrally) in consultation with ISC based on calendar of 
University of Mumbai. 
2) Department academic calendar of events is prepared:  
i. It is based on institute academic calendar of events. 
ii. It consists of the activities planned for the semester which 
includes academic activities, internal test dates, con duction 
of events like organizing guest lectures etc. 
TEACHING PEDAGOGIES 
Learning in Classrooms 
To increase the student’s participation, interaction, learning 
and interest in lectures, Faculties use the following options 
• Chalk board 
• Projector  
• Smart board 
• Audio-video teaching aids 
• Inclusion of visuals and animation  
• Online resource from standard source etc. 
• Presentation by students to enhance learning 
• Group discussion on subject topic 
• Mindmaps, Simulation Tools 
• Moodle, e-learning platform 
a) To recall the content learnt in class. 
b) Absent student gets the benefit of learning the content of 
their missed lecture. 
c) Study material is readily available of entire subject. 
d) Facilitates HOD to monitor the progress of academics. 
Our classrooms are well equipped with  
• Projectors 
• Smart Board 
• Air conditioners 
• Laptops are used for teaching purposes and internet 
facility is available to students and faculties.  
 
 
 
 
247 
 
• Power backup for IT infrastructure. 
Learning in Laboratory 
Quality of Laboratory experience   
• Experiments are planned and conducted as prescribed 
by UOM syllabus. 
• List of experiments may be revised.  
• Lab manual provides general guidelines and procedure 
for conduct of experiments. 
• Every student gets an opportunity to get hands on work 
experience on kits, equipments, computers etc. 
• Results/output obtained are monitored by the faculties. 
• Experiment writing is completed by the students 
immediately after the completion of   the experime nts 
and is assessed/evaluated in the next laboratory session 
as per rubrics. 
Learning through projects 
i) Mini Projects
