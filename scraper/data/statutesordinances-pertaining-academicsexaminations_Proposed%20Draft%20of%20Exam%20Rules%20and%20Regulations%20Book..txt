2. Question Paper Design  - The ESE papers will be structured to minimize rote learning, 
promoting critical thinking and deep comprehension. 
3. Typical Duration - ESE exams generally last between 2 to 3 hours, as determined by the 
institution. 
4. Coverage - Includes the entire syllabus of the course, ensuring a thorough evaluation of 
student learning. 
Practical and Laboratory Examinations 
In addition to theoretical evaluations, practical and laboratory examinations are integral for courses 
involving hands -on work. These assessments aim to evaluate practical skills, experimental 
techniques, and real-world problem-solving abilities. Key considerations include: 
1. Hands-On Skill Assessment  - Testing the ability to apply theoretical knowledge in 
practical contexts. 
2. Separate Passing Criteria  - Practical components often have distinct passing criteria, 
reflecting the unique demands of hands-on learning. 
3. Real-World Application - Focus on experimental accuracy, data analysis, and the correct 
use of laboratory equipment. 
 
4.4 Accommodative Special Examination:

the regular Mid-Semester Examination or the End -Semester Examination due to unforeseen and 
compelling reasons. The decision to grant a Special Examination will rest with the institution, 
based on its established policies and a careful review of the submitted evidence. 
4.5 Opportunity for Academic Improvement: Re-Examination: 
Autonomous institutions will provide students with an opportunity to reappear for examinations 
in courses where they wish to improve their previously obtained grades or to clear any courses in 
which they may have not achieved the required passing grade. The regulations governing re -
examinations will specify the number of attempts permitted, the courses eligible for re -
examination, any associated fees, and the process for applying for a re-examination. 
 
5. Mandatory Attendance Requirements for Examination Eligibility: 
Recognizing the importance of consistent engagement with the learning process, students will be 
required to maintain a minimum 75%percentage of attendance in all lectures  (25% relaxation 
considered for medical ground), and for tutorials, and practical sessions it should be 100% for each 
course to be eligible to appear for the corresponding Mid -Semester and End -Semester 
Examinations. The specific minimum attendance percentage will be determined by the respective 
autonomous institution and will be clearly communicated to the students at the beginning of each 
semester.  
6. Transparent Examination Fees Structure: 
The autonomous institutions will establish a clear and transparent fee structure for various 
examinations, including the Mid -Semester Examination, End -Semester Examination, Special 
Examinations, and Re-Examinations. The details of these fees will be duly notified to the students 
well in advance through official channels. 
• Regular examination fee --- 3000

To ensure academic rigor and a minimum level of competency, students must secure a minimum 
passing grade in individual course, encompassing both the internal assessments (ISE and MSE) 
Page 19 of 31 
 
 
and the external assessment (ESE) components. The specific passing marks or grades for each 
course will be clearly defined by the institution. 
To successfully complete a course and progress academically, students must meet specific passing 
criteria that reflect both their understanding of the course material and their performance in 
assessments. These criteria are designed to ensure a consistent standard of academic excellence 
and competency across all courses. 
Absolute Grading with a minimum 40% marks for UG should be obtained by a student to pass 
a course considering addition of ISE1, MSE, ISE2 and ESE marks.  
There is no separate passing head for ISE1, MSE, ISE2 or ESE. Even though there is not a separate 
head of passing, it is expected that learner should satisfactorily complete all the continuous 
assessment components in all the courses.

7.1.1 Minimum Requirements: 
To pass a course, a student must achieve the following minimum thresholds: 
• End Semester Examination (ESE) Performance: 
o Students must secure at least 40% of the maximum marks in the ESE to pass the 
course. 
o The ESE typically evaluates comprehensive knowledge and understanding of the 
entire course syllabus, including both theoretical concepts and practical 
applications. 
• Internal Assessment (IA) Performance (ISE): 
Page 20 of 31 
 
 
o A minimum of 40% of the total possible marks in the Internal Assessment (IA) 
is required. 
o The IA comprises ISE & MSE  may include various components, such as class 
tests, quizzes, assignments, practical work, projects, presentations, and attendance, 
depending on the course structure. 
• Overall Grade Requirement: 
o In addition to meeting the minimum individual requirements for ESE and IA, 
students must secure an overall grade of C (or its equivalent) when combining the 
scores from both IA and ESE components. 
o The overall grade reflects a student’s comprehensive performance and 
understanding of the course content, and is typically determined using a grading 
scale that may vary by institution. 
 
 
 
7.2 Detailed Grade Compilation Guidelines: 
The final grade for each course will be meticulously determined by considering the student's 
performance in all components of evaluation, including the In-Semester Evaluation (ISE), the Mid-
Semester Examination (MSE), and the End -Semester Examination (ESE) . The institution will 
establish a pre-defined weightage distribution for each of these components, which will be clearly 
articulated in the course syllabus. 
The guidelines for the absolute grade compilation are as follows  
➢ There will be no individual passing head for any course. Pass or fail will be based on total marks 
obtained.  
➢ The total marks i.e. addition of ISE1, ISE2, MSE and ESE for a course are used for grade 
compilation process.  
➢ The Grade Compilation Process shall involve the following steps:  
7.2.1 Absolute grading system is applicable for all courses  
1. Student securing 40% or more marks should be awarded the Passing grade ‘P’ or higher grades 
based on the overall performance in the course.  
Page 21 of 31 
 
 
 2. Student unable to secure at least 40% marks considering all the components of exam like ISE1, 
ISE2, MSE & ESE combined shall be graded with ‘F’ grade considered to be failed in the 
examination of the said course.  
3. There shall be different grades with their numerical equivalence as specified in detail below, as 
grades specified from ‘F’ to ‘O’.  However, for a student to get a grade D or above in any course, 
he/she would have to appear in the MSE and ESE.  
4. Considering the specific constraints,  Principal may constitute a committee chaired by Dean 
Quality Assurance to examine the grades awarded in a course.  
5. In case of Re -examination only absolute grading should be awarded with an upper cap of ‘ A’ 
grade.  
7.2.2 Additional Requirements: 
• Practical and Laboratory Courses: 
o Courses with practical or laboratory components may have additional passing 
criteria, reflecting the hands-on skills and technical competencies required for those 
subjects. 
o In such cases, students may need to achieve separate passing marks in the practical 
components, independent of the theoretical portions. 
o The specific criteria, including minimum marks and required practical 
competencies, will be clearly communicated by the respective departments. 
• Institution-Specific Standards: 
o In certain cases, the institution may prescribe higher passing thresholds or 
additional criteria beyond the minimum university requirements to ensure academic 
rigor. 
o These criteria may include higher overall percentage requirements, additional 
project submissions, or mandatory attendance standards, subject to the approval of 
the University of Mumbai. 
o Such enhancements are intended to promote a deeper understanding of the course 
material and better prepare students for professional and academic challenges. 
7.2.3 Transparency and Communication: 
• The specific passing marks, grading scales, and evaluation criteria for each course will be 
clearly outlined in the course syllabus and communicated to students at the beginning of 
the semester. 
Page 22 of 31 
 
 
• This transparency ensures that students have a clear understanding of the performance 
expectations and can plan their studies accordingly. 
• Regular feedback from instructors, along with periodic performance reviews, will further 
support students in meeting these criteria.
