learning at engineering colleges affiliated to the University of Mumbai. They are guided by statutory 
compliance with the Maharashtra Public Universities Act 2016 , UGC and AICTE norms , and the 
National Education Policy 2020. 
 
1. Program Duration and Structure 
• The Bachelor of Engineering (B.E./B.Tech) program is a 4 -year full-time course, comprising 8 
semesters.

June). 
• Students must complete a total of approximately 160–170 credits, including core, elective, 
laboratory, and project-based courses. 
 
2. Eligibility and Admission 
Admission to undergraduate engineering programs is governed by the policies and procedures 
established by the Directorate of Technical Education (DTE), Maharashtra, and includes the following 
key criteria: 
a. Standard Admission (First-Year Entry):
