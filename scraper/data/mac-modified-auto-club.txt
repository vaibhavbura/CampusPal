With 2018 sales of EUR 14.6 billion, Covestro is among the world’s largest polymer companies. Business activities are focused on the manufacture of high-tech polymer materials and the development of innovative solutions for products used in many areas of daily life. The main segments served are the automotive, construction, wood processing and furniture, and electrical and electronics industries. Other sectors include sports and leisure, cosmetics, health and the chemical industry itself. The company is very well established in India with three manufacturing facilities across the country at Greater Noida, Ankleshwar and Cuddalore. Covestro has 30 production sites worldwide and employs approximately 16,800 people (calculated as full-time equivalents) at the end of 2018.
Covestro develops sustainable solutions to the greatest challenges of our age: climate change, resource depletion, urban expansion, population growth and the resulting increase in awareness of environmental issues. These will inevitably lead to a higher demand for renewable energies, alternative resources, energy-efficient transportation, and sustainable, affordable housing.
Covestro aims to meet this demand with long-lasting, light, environmentally friendly and cost-effective materials, which in many cases are suitable replacements for conventional materials such as steel and glass.
We do so by focusing on innovation and sustainability and by following our objective: "To make the world a brighter place". We do all this by staying close to our three corporate values: curious, courageous and colorful. It is this distinctive mindset that enables us to push boundaries and strive for the better – day by day.
