 
 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CELL (R&D CELL) 
 
A. P. Shah Institute of Technology  has promoted meaningful scientific industrial Research 
and Development activities with a vision and mission to pursue and promote Re search in 
Frontier Technologies as well as in the various disciplines of Engineering.   
For any education, specifically technical education, the basic model of a ‘teaching – only’ 
institution is inadequate to ensure quality education. In all disciplines of technical education, 
knowledge is dynamic wit h new technologies being introduced very frequently. In this 
scenario, it is not possible for the teachers to deliver good quality instructions without being 
tuned to the current developments in the subjects, for which they must constantly update 
their knowledge. A well-recognized way to deal with this paradigm is for the teachers to be 
active researchers in the areas in which they intereste d. As researchers, they need to 
understand the past and recent developments in their subject areas. 
Research and Development cell was established at APSIT to inculcate research and innovative 
skills among faculty and students. R&D Cell provides a platfor m for creativity and innovation 
to flourish young minds in Institute. Innovative breakthroughs will happen only because of 
meticulous efforts of R&D. The Institute provides SEED amount to facilitate basic common 
research infrastructure for individuals to execute collaborative work.  
APSIT R&D cell is a nominated committee consisting of Professors from various programs of 
Engineering. This committee oversees the smooth and efficient coordination of research and 
development activities in the Institute, thus fostering overall growth. The organizational 
structure consists of Advisor, Principal, Dean and Coordinato rs for facilita ting the routine 
functioning of the cell.

INITIATIVES TAKEN TO  INCULCATE THE SPIRI T OF RESEARCH AMONGS T FACULTY AND 
STUDENTS ARE AS FOLLOWS 
A. Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Cell 
Innovation and Entrep reneurship Development Cell (IEDC) is established to cultivate an 
entrepreneurial culture in APSIT and to foster the techno entrepreneurship for generation of 
wealth and employment by APSITIANS. The IEDC helps the student community to conduct the 
research work and survey for identifying entrepreneurial opportunities. The main objective 
of promoting an entrepreneurship among the youth is to nurture the passion for self -
employment. This will open the gates for the creation of a new knowledge -based innovative 
hi-tech ventures, industries and a new breed of techno entrepreneurs and more avenues of 
employment opportunities, thus turning the job seekers into the job creators and in this 
process, leading a nation towards the industrial excellence and the self -reliance. The 
Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Cell of this college aims towards achieving the 
above. 
B. Uddan Incubation centre 
To have your own Start-up you need to know the “Technical know-how” of today's industry. 
Here we provide such an incubati on centre for students to develop, evolve, and learn from 
their mistakes and PROGRESS. 
The significant factors indicating potential growth in the research activities includes the 
enhancement in the research publications in peer reviewed journals, Research Projects/ 
grants, Patents, Collaborations, Doctoral program and Faculty development. R & D cell is 
focusing the attention on the following major activities: 
C. Research Publications 
As a result of tireless efforts taken in the research activities, the college has to its credit many 
research publications in National and International peer reviewed Journals. The faculty 
members have also presented research papers in various reputed national and international 
conferences. The total 108 plus research papers have published during academic Year 2017- 
to 2020, out of which 80 research papers have been published in journals and remaining have 
been published in conferences. 
D. Research Projects 
One of the important criteria to judge the performance of research output  of the institution 
is to obtain recognition by reputed Government/Autonomous sponsoring agencies towards 
generation of funds to conduct quality research. The institute would attempt to receive a 
number of research grants from agencies like DST, AICTE, IEI , DRDO, CSIR etc.  in near 
future.  In addition to this, APSIT has also encouraged the faculty members to initiate research 
by giving the seed money to undertake various minor research projects.  
E. Ph. D. Programs 
Quality engineering education coupled with  innovative research and development is 
absolutely essential towards the overall faculty development. The APSIT encourages higher 
education of faculty members to keep abreast of continuous technological development. 
 
Accordingly Institute promotes participa tion of faculty in innovative research by providing a 
conducive environment, necessary facilities and motivation. 
 
Facilities available for R&D  
i. The researchers are given highest priority in the institute. All the departments have 
well equipped laboratory facilities for the research and it can be made available to the 
students for research work. 
ii. For multidisciplinary research projects, faculty and students can work in other 
department laboratories.  
iii. Institute has purchased various latest software for research activities which helps the 
faculty and students in developing their projects. Through the available educational 
software, faculty and students can take advantage of a variety of tools and resources 
in the academic program. These will help prepare studen ts for tomorrow's 
infrastructure workforce. Users can learn the powerful applications that are in use by 
infrastructure professionals today. 
iv. The software and tools in APSIT SKILLS Centre will help optimise the higher education 
institution’s value for all students & faculties by tapping into the insights and solutions 
derived from this  software. This software will enable APSIT to integrate educational 
skills and real -time job experiences in collaboration with businesses. It will give 
students access to advanced technology and thereby help learn emerging job skills. 
v. The college has labs with 700+ computers and provided high speed internet facility to 
faculty as well as students. 
vi. The Library has an extensive collection of books  and e-books with 28000+ books in 
volumes covering all aspects of engineering.  
vii. The library facilitates access to more than 400 video lectures under NPTEL prepared 
by various IITs. 
viii. E-Resources are also available and can be accessed from any computer in the campus.
