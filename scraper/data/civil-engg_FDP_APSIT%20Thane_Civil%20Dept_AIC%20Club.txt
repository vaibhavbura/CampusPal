In today's digital age, data analysis , and data 
processing have become essential skills for 
professionals across various fields, including core 
engineering branches like Civil, Mechanical, and 
Electrical Engineering. Damage detect ion, vibration 
identification, 3D reconstruction, etc in the field of 
civil engineering ; generative design, predictive 
maintenance, and control optimization in mechanical 
engineering and planning, distribution, and automation 
of power systems in electrical engineering  are a few 
applications where AI and ML  are effectively used  
nowadays. The main objective of the faculty 
development program is to introduce the participants 
to the concept of data analysis, data processing, and 
modeling aspects using AI . The participants will have 
hands-on experience with the data sets shared.
