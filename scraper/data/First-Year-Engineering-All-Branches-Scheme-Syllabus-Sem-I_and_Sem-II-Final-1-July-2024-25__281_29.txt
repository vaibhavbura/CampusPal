Preamble 
 
To meet the challenge of ensuring excellence and NEP 2020 policy in engineering education, the issue of quality needs to 
be addressed, debated, and taken forward systematically.  Accreditation i s the principal means of quality assurance in 
higher education. The major emphasis of the accreditation process is to measure the outcomes of the program that is being 
accredited. In line with this Faculty of Science and Technology (in particular Engineeri ng) of the University of Mumbai 
has taken the lead in incorporating the philosophy of NEP 2020 education in the process of curriculum development. 
 
The First Year Engineering course is a broad foundation training program to impart scientific and logical thinking Training 
to learners in general with a choice of course selection in the Basic sciences and Engineering Sciences. Simultaneously 
NEP- 2020 objectives demand nurturing the basic skills required for familiarizing within the respective chosen Branch of  
Engineering by the learner. Keeping this in view, a pool of courses is offered in Basic sciences covering fundamentals 
required to understand modern engineering practices and emerging trends in technology. Considering the change in 
pedagogy and the convenience of the stress-free learning process, in the course work under heads of Engineering Sciences, 
a choice-based subject pool is offered in the second semester. Essentially to give a glimpse of trends in the industry under 
vocational skill practices, the pool is offered to nurture and develop creative skills in contemporary industrial practices.  
Criteria met in the structure is the opportunity for learners to choose the course of their interest in all disciplines. 
 
Basic sciences cover Applied Physics and  Elective Physics, Applied Chemistry and Elective Chemistry, and Applied 
Mathematics where a pool of subjects are given for selection, the rationale for the same is that generalized basic science 
courses are not feasible from learners' point of view. Consi dering the present scenario, diverse choices need to be made 
available to fulfill the expectation of a learner to aspire for a career in the field of current trends of Technology and 
interdisciplinary research. Ability enhancement can be achieved in Undergraduate training by giving an objective viewpoint 
to the learning process and transitioning a learner from a rote learner to a creative professional, for the purpose Design 
Thinking is introduced in the First Semester to orient a journey learner to become a skilled professional.  Considering the 
NEP-2020 structure of award of Certificate & Diploma at multiple exit-point pools of Vocational skills is arranged for 
giving exposure to the current Industry practices. 
 
Faculty resolved that course objectives and course outcomes are to be clearly defined for every course so that all faculty 
members in affiliated higher education institutes understand the depth and approach of the course to be taught, which will 
enhance the learner’s learning process. NEP 2020 gradi ng system enables a much -required shift in focus from teacher -
centric to continuous-based learner-centric education since the workload estimated is based on the investment of time in 
learning and not in teaching. It also focuses on continuous evaluation wh ich will enhance the quality of education. Credit 
assignment for courses is based on a 15-week teaching-learning process for NEP 2020, however, the content of courses is 
to be taught in 12-13 weeks and the remaining 2-3 weeks are to be utilized for revisio n, tutorial, guest lectures, coverage 
of content beyond the syllabus, etc. 
 
There was a concern that in the present system, the first-year syllabus must not be heavily loaded to the learner and it is of 
utmost importance that the learner entering into the first year of an engineering course should feel at ease by lowering the 
burden of syllabus and credits. This is necessary for a learner to get accustomed to the new environment of a college and 
to create a bond between the teacher and the learner. The pres ent curriculum will be implemented for the First Year of 
Engineering from the academic year 20 24-25. Subsequently , this system will be carried forward for Second Year 
Engineering in the academic year 2025-26, and for Third Year and Final Year Engineering in the academic years 2026-27, 
and 2027-28, respectively.

Rationale: 
Most of the engineering branches are being off -spring of basic sciences where physics is playing a 
pivotal role in concept and understanding of foundation of core engineering branches. This syllabus is 
developed by keeping in mind, needs of all branches that we offer in University of Mumbai. In the 
distribution of modules, core physics and its applied form are given priority. Further, it is ensured that 
these modules will cover prerequisites needed for engineering courses to be introduced in higher 
semesters as core subjects or as interdisciplinary subjects in respective branches.

Note: 
1. This is an audit course.  
2. This course is to be taught by faculty from every teaching department 
3. Lecture hours are to be used f or interactive discussion, placing the proposals about the topics 
at hand and motivating students to reflect, explore and verify them. 
4. In the discussions, the mentor encourages the student to connect with one’s own self and do 
self-observation, self-reflection and self-exploration 
5. One or two periods from each module may be used for tutorials. These are important for the 
course. The difference is that the laboratory is everyday life, and practical are how you behave 
and work in real life.  
6. Depending on the n ature of topics, worksheets, home assignment and/or activity can be 
included.  The practice sessions (tutorials) would also provide support to a student in 
performing actions commensurate to his/her beliefs. It is intended that this would lead to 
development of commitment, namely behaving and working based on basic human values.

3)     For Amateur Radio 
 Amateur Radio is a scientific activity popularly known as “Ham Radio”. Amateur radio operators use 
two way radio stations and communicate with others similarly authorized using various modes of 
communication like voice, morse code, computers, internet etc. The things that amateur radio operators 
do with their radios are as diverse as the people themse lves. The advanced amateur radio 
communication techniques include Automatic Position Reporting Systems using GPS information, 
Internet linking of Repeater stations, Interface with internet for exchange of emails, images etc as well 
as visual communication modes. 
 Amateur (HAM) Radio is both a Hobby activity and Service. It is an activity of self learning, inter -
communication & technical investigation carried on the duly authorized persons (i.e. Amateur Radio 
Operators) for a personal aim and without pecuniar y interest. A wireless communication network 
through Amateur Radio is one of the most effective and alternate medium of communication and can 
play a significant role in providing reliable communications when other normal communications fail. 
The skills of the trained amateur radio operator can be used for public service in times of need and 
national  emergencies. 
156 
 
 For participation in ISRO programs for student satellites and to act as a  volunteer for radio monitoring 
of  space missions, owning an Amateur (H AM) Radio operators certification is a legal and technical 
essential condition . 
 The Activity can be started at college level or at University inducted Nodal Centers. Interested faculties 
can be assigned  a role of coordinator and enroll students for becoming Radio enthusiasts.
