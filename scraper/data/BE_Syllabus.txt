Guidelines: 
 
1. Project Topic Selection and Allocation: 
• Project topic selection Process to be defined and followed: 
o Project orientation can be given at the end of sixth semester. 
o Students should be informed about the domain and domain experts whose guidance  
can be taken before selecting projects. 
o Student‘s should be recommended to refer papers from reputed conferences/journals 
like IEEE, Elsevier, ACM etc. which are not more than 3 years old for review of  
literature. 
o Dataset selected for the project should be large and realtime 
o Students can certainly take ideas from anywhere, but be sure that they should evolve 
them in the unique way to suit their project requirements. Students can be informed  
to refer Digital India portal, SIH portal or any other hackathon portal forproblem  
selection. 
 
• Topics can be finalized with respect to following criterion: 
o Topic Selection : The topics selected should be novel in nature (Product based,  
Application based or Research based) or should work towards removing the lacuna  
in currently existing systems. 
o Technology Used: Use of latest technology or modern tools can be encouraged. AI, 
ML, DL, NNFS, NLP based algorithms can be implemented 
o Students should not repeat work done previously (work done in the last three years). 
o Project work must be carried out by the group of at least 3 students and maximum 4. 
o The project work can be undertaken in a research institute or 
organization/Industry/any business establishment. (out-house projects) 
o The project proposal presentations can be scheduled according to the domains 
and should be judged by faculty who are expert in the domain. 
o Head of department and senior staff along with project coordinators will take 
decision regarding final selection of projects. 
o Guide allocation should be done and students have to submit weekly progress report 
to the internal guide. 
o Internal guide has to keep track of the progress of the project and also has to maintain 
attendance report. This progress report can be used for awarding term work marks. 
o In case of industry/ out-house projects, visit by internal guide will be preferred and 
external members can be called during the presentation at various levels 
 
2. Project Report Format: 
 
At the end of semester, each group needs to prepare a project report as per the guidelines issued 
by the University of Mumbai. 
 
A project report should preferably contain following details: 
o Abstract 
o Introduction 
o Literature Survey/ Existing system 
o Limitation Existing system or research gap 
o Problem Statement and Objective 
o Proposed System 
o Analysis/Framework/ Algorithm 
o Design details 
o Methodology (your approach to solve the problem) Proposed System 
o Experimental Set up 
o Details of Database or details about input to systems or selected data 
o Performance Evaluation Parameters (for Validation) 
o Software and Hardware Setup 
o Implementation Plan for Next Semester 
o Timeline Chart for Term1 and Term-II (Project Management tools can be 
used.) 
o References 
 
Desirable 
 
Students can be asked to undergo some Certification course (for the technical skill set thatwill be 
useful and applicable for projects.) 
3. Term Work: 
 
Distribution of marks for term work shall be done based on following: 
o Weekly Log Report 
o Project Work Contribution 
o Project Report (Spiral Bound) (both side print) 
o Term End Presentation (Internal) 
The final certification and acceptance of TW ensures the satisfactory 
performance on theaboveaspects. 
4. Oral and Practical: 
Oral and Practical examination (Final Project Evaluation) of Project 1 should be conducted  
byInternal and External examiners approved by University of Mumbai at the end of the  
semester. 
 
Suggested quality evaluation parameters are as follows: 
o Quality of problem selected 
o Clarity of problem definition and feasibility of problem solution 
o Relevance to the specialization / industrial trends 
o Originality 
o Clarity of objective and scope 
o Quality of analysis and design
