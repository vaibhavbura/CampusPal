 
 
What is Design? 
A design is defined by Section 2(d) of the Designs Act 2001 as only the features 
of a shape pattern, configuration arrangement, or ornament of lines or colours that 
are applied to any article that is two dimensional, three dimensional, or both by 
an industrial process or other means, whether mechanical, manual, or chemically 
separated or mixed, and are judged solely by the eye in the finished article; 
However, it is not taken into account in terms of construction principles or 
anything that is essentially a mechanical unit. 
Simply placed, a style is the product's overall aesthetic presentation that is distinct 
from other products. Form, colour combination, line structure, and other factors 
may all contribute to the appearance's beauty. The important thing to remember 
is that the design must be able to be adapted to an article. As a result, the design 
cannot exist in a vacuum ; It must be used on both two -dimensional and three -
dimensional objects.

Why Registers a Design? 
A product's visual appeal is enhanced by design. The majority of customers make 
purchasing choices based on the appearance of a commodity. Given the value of 
design in consumer decision -making, it is only appropriate to preserve original 
and exclusive designs by granting the designers the freedom to use them. And if 
a product's concept is replicated, it may be detrimental to the designer's enterprise. 
1. Statutory right – comes into effect only after registration – territorial 
2. The right to prohibit anyone from making, importing, selling, or exporting goods 
that have a similar appearance or are a fraud or an apparent imitation. 
3. The Monopoly Game Ten-year period with a five-year extension option 
4. Provides you with a distinct selling point (USP) 
5. It's a valuable commodity that can be authorised. 
What are the requirements for Registering a Design? 
The Designs Act, 2000, lists the following requirements to be met before a design 
can be registered: 
1. Novelty—the concept must be exclusive and cannot have been written or used 
in any other region. A current template on a new subject -matter, on the other 
hand, may be recorded. 
2. It must be extended or appropriate to a piece of writing. Industrial plans or 
prototypes are not eligible for design approval. 
3. A manufacturing method should be used to apply the design to an article. 
Paintings and drawings that are not mass -produced in a manufacturing process 
are not eligible for approval. 
4. In the final article, the template should be visible. This is due to the fact that the 
architecture is exclusively judged by the eye. 
5. A mechanical instrument cannot be recorded in any mode of operation. 
6. A trademark, property mark, or other creative rights as specified by the 
Copyright Act of 1957 cannot be used in a design. 
There must be significant variations between the design and those that have already 
been registered. Designs that are similar to or have a strong resemblance to already 
existing designs, even though they are slightly new, do not apply for registration. 
 
 
 
What are the rights conferred by registration of a Design? 
The owner of a design who registers it gets the copyright to use it for the article 
for which it was registered. Which effectively ensures that the owner gets a one-
time licence to use the template for the specific article for which it was registered. 
When a signed design is violated, the author has the power to sue the infringer 
for damages. 
As a result, registering a specification is critical for protecting the product's 
appearance. It's necessary to remember that an article must exist independently 
of its architecture. This means that the article will continue to survive even though 
the template isn't added to it. As a result, stickers, logos, and other similar items 
are not considered articles for brand registration. 
 

 
 
The Application for registration of a design can be filed by the Applicant himself 
or by a professional employed by the Applicant for this purpose. (If a professional 
is employed, then the power of attorney has to be filed along with the Application) 
Below is a list of the comprehensive steps involved in registering a Design in 
India: 
1. Submit a properly completed registration form, along with four versions of the 
Design representation, along with the necessary fees (of size 33cm x 25cm with 
suitable margins). The drawing must clearly represent the design's characteristics 
from all angles and state the viewpoint. 
2. The application must be forwarded to the Design Wing of the Patent Office in 
Kolkata, or to any Patent Office branch office in Delhi, Mumbai, or Chennai, 
along with the necessary documentation. (If it's not online) 
3. The filing is numbered, dated, and picked up for review as soon as it arrives at 
the Patent Office. (Please notic e that, unlike patents, no specific request for 
review is required.) Design applications are immediately examined after they are 
submitted.) 
4. If any flaws in the application are discovered, they are reported to the Applicant 
or his Agent. 
5. The errors m ust be repaired within six months of the application's formal 
submission date. 
6. If the faults are not corrected as prescribed by the Controller, the claimant is 
given a personal hearing. The Controller's decision is reported to the Applicant 
or his Agent in writing (with reasons) after the hearing. 
7. The Applicant has three months from the date of the Controller's order to file 
an appeal with the High Court. 
8. The Application is published in the Patent Office Journal until it has been 
approved. 
The term of Design: 
A Design is valid for ten years from the date of registration after it has been 
registered. By filing an Application for Renewal along with the required charge, 
this limit may be extended for another 5 years. 
 
 
In India, registering a template does not have to be done by a physical filing. E -
filing for Designs has been available since the 9th of March, 2015. The e -filing 
procedure is identical to the procedure outlined above. The added benefit is that 
if you already have a digital signature for patent e-filings, you can use it for design 
e-filing as well. 
Let us now examine the Industrial Design Fee system in India. The current fee 
arrangement is in compliance with the Design (Amendment) Rules, 2014. For the 
first time, the 2014 Amendment (effectiv e December 30, 2014) established two 
groups of applicants for Design registration: Other than Natural Persons and 
Natural Persons. The latter category is further sub-divided into Small Entity and 
Others except Small Entity. Prior to the Amendment, the same  amount of fees 
was applicable to all categories of Applicants. With the Amendment in place, 
each listed category has to pay a different amount for the Design Registration 
Process. (Please refer to the below Table for the exact fee structure in India) 
The fee for a small entity has been fixed between the fees for a natural person and 
fees for all persons other than a natural person (except small entity). This, in 
effect,, means that there is a 50% reduction in the fee for a small entity (as 
opposed to a lar ge entity). The Amendment has also introduced a new Form. 
Form-24. This Form has to be submitted along with a new Application, if an 
Applicant wants to claim the status of a Small Entity. It is important to note that 
Form-24 has to be filed at least once a gainst the application number for 
subsequent documents for which a fee has been prescribed.
