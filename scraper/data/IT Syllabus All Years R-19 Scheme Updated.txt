Preamble 

 
 
To meet the challenge of ensuring excellence in engineering education, the issue of quality needs to be 
addressed, debated and taken forward in a systematic manner. Accreditation is the principal means of quality 
assurance in higher education. The major emphasis of accreditation process is to measure the outcomes of the 
program that is being accredited. In line with this Faculty of Science and Technology (in particular 
Engineering)of University of Mumbai has taken a lead in incorporating philosophy of outcome based education 
in the process of curriculum development. 
Faculty resolved that course objectives and course outcomes are to be clearly defined for each course, so that 
all faculty members in affiliated institutes understand the depth and approach of course to be taught, which will 
enhance learner’s learning process. Choice based Credit and grading system enables a much-required shift in 
focus from teacher-centric to learner-centric education since the workload estimated is based on the investment 
of time in learning and not in teaching. It also focuses on continuous evaluation which will enhance the quality 
of education. Credit assignment for courses is based on 15 weeks teaching learning process, however content 
of courses is to be taught in 13 weeks and remaining 2 weeks to be utilized for revision, guest lectures, coverage 
of content beyond syllabus etc. 
There was a concern that the earlier revised curriculum more focused on providing information and knowledge 
across various domains of the said program, which led to heavily loading of students in terms of direct contact 
hours. In this regard, faculty of science and technology resolved that to minimize the burden of contact hours, 
total credits of entire program will be of 170, wherein focus is not only on providing knowledge but also on 
building skills, attitude and self learning. Therefore in the present curriculum skill based laboratories and mini 
projects are made mandatory across all disciplines of engineering in second and third year of programs, which 
will definitely facilitate self learning of students. The overall credits and approach of curriculum proposed in 
the present revision is in line with AICTE model curriculum. 
The present curriculum will be implemented for Second Year of Engineering from the academic year 2020-21. 
Subsequently this will be carried forward for Third Year and Final Year Engineering in the academic years 
2021-22, 2022-23, respectively.

Incorporation and Implementation of Online Contents from 
NPTEL/ Swayam Platform 

 
 
 

The curriculum revision is mainly focused on knowledge component, skill based activities and project 
based activities. Self learning opportunities are provided to learners. In the revision process this time in 
particular Revised syllabus of ‘C ‘ scheme wherever possible additional resource links of platforms such 
as NPTEL, Swayam are appropriately provided. In an earlier revision of curriculum in the year 2012 and 
2016 in Revised scheme ‘A' and ‘B' respectively, efforts were made to use online contents more 
appropriately as additional learning materials to enhance learning of students.  
In the current revision based on the recommendation of AICTE model curriculum overall credits are 
reduced to 171, to provide opportunity of self learning to learner. Learners are now getting sufficient time 
for self learning either through online courses or additional projects for enhancing their knowledge and 
skill sets. 
The Principals/ HoD’s/ Faculties of all the institute are required to motivate and encourage learners to use 
additional online resources available on platforms such as NPTEL/ Swayam. Learners can be advised to 
take up online courses, on successful completion they are required to submit certification for the same. 
This will definitely help learners to facilitate their enhanced learning based on their interest.

Preface By BoS  

 
It is our honor and a privilege to present the Rev-2019 ‘C’ scheme syllabus of Bachelor of 
Engineering in Information Technology (effective from year 2019-20) with inclusion of cutting 
edge technology. Information Technology is comparatively a young branch among other 
engineering disciplines in the University of Mumbai. It is evident from the placement statistics of 
various colleges affiliated to the University of Mumbai that IT branch has taken the lead in the 
placement.  
 
The branch also provides multi-faceted scope like better placement and promotion of 
entrepreneurship culture among students, and increased Industry Institute Interactions. Industries 
views are considered as stakeholders will design of the syllabus of Information Technology. As per 
Industries views only 16 % graduates are directly employable. One of the reasons is a syllabus 
which is not in line with the latest technologies. Our team of faculties has tried to include all the 
latest technologies in the syllabus. Also first time we are giving skill-based labs and Mini-project 
to students from third semester onwards which will help students to work on latest IT technologies. 
Also the first time we are giving the choice of elective from fifth semester such that students will 
be master in one of the IT domain. The syllabus is peer reviewed by experts from reputed industries 
and as per their suggestions it covers future trends in IT technology and research opportunities 
available due to these trends. 
 
We would like to thank senior faculties of IT department of all colleges affiliated to University of 
Mumbai for significant contribution in framing the syllabus. Also on behalf of all faculties we thank 
all the industry experts for their valuable feedback and suggestions. We sincerely hope that the 
revised syllabus will help all graduate engineers to face the future challenges in the field of 
information and technology 
 
 
Program Specific Outcome for graduate Program in Information Technology 
 
1. Apply Core Information Technology knowledge to develop stable and secure IT system. 
2. Design, IT infrastructures for an enterprise using concepts of best practices in information 
    Technology and security domain. 
3. Ability to work in multidisciplinary projects and make it IT enabled. 
4. Ability to adapt latest trends and technologies like Analytics, Blockchain, Cloud, Data science.

3) A university has two types of students — graduate 
students and research students. The University 
maintains the record of name, age and programme of 
every student. For graduate students, additional 
information like percentage of marks and stream, like 
science, commerce, etc. is recorded; whereas for 
research students, additionally, specialization and years 
of working experience, if any, is recorded. Each class 
has a constructor. The constructor of subclasses makes 
a call to constructor of the superclass. Assume that every 
constructor has the same number of parameters as the 
number of instance variables. In addition, every 
subclass has a method that may update the instance 
variable values of that subclass. All the classes have a 
function display_student_info( ), the subclasses must 
override this method of the base class. Every student is 
either a graduate student or a research student.  
Perform the following tasks for the description given 
above using Java :  

(i) Create the three classes with proper instance 
variables and methods, with suitable inheritance.  
(ii) Create at least one parameterised constructor for 
each class.  
(iii) Implement the display_student_info( ) method in 
each class.  
 

4) An employee works in a particular department of an 
organization. Every employee has an employee number, 
name and draws a particular salary. Every department 
has a name and a head of department. The head of 
department is an employee. Every year a new head of 
department takes over. Also, every year an employee is 
given an annual salary enhancement. Identify and 
design the classes for the above description with suitable 
instance variables and methods. The classes should be 
such that they implement information hiding. You must 
give logic in support of your design. Also create two 
objects of each class. 

 
5) Consider a hierarchy, where a sportsperson can either 
be an athlete or a hockey player. Every sportsperson has 
a unique name. An athlete is characterized by the event 
in which he/she participates; whereas a hockey player is 
characterised by the number of goals scored by him/her.  

Perform the following tasks using Java :  
(i)Create the class hierarchy with suitable instance 
variables and methods.  
(ii) Create a suitable constructor for each class.  
(iii) Create a method named display_all_info with 
suitable parameters. This method should display all the 
information about the object of a class.   
(iv) Write the main method that demonstrates 
polymorphism.  
 
6) Create an interface vehicle and classes like bicycle, 

 



 

car, bike etc, having common functionalities and put all 
the common functionalities in the interface. Classes like

Guidelines for Mini Project  

 Students shall form a group of 3 to 4 students, while forming a group shall not be allowed less than 
three or more than four students, as it is a group activity. 

 Students should do survey and identify needs, which shall be converted into problem statement for 
mini project in consultation with faculty supervisor/head of department/internal committee of 
faculties. 

 Students hall submit implementation plan in the form of Gantt/PERT/CPM chart, which will cover 
weekly activity of mini project. 

 A log book to be prepared by each group, wherein group can record weekly work progress, 
guide/supervisor can verify and record notes/comments.   

 Faculty supervisor may give inputs to students during mini project activity; however, focus shall be 
on self-learning.   

 



 

 Students in a group shall understand problem effectively, propose multiple solution and select best 
possible solution in consultation with guide/ supervisor. 

 Students shall convert the best solution into working model using various components of their 
domain areas and demonstrate. 

 The solution to be validated with proper justification and report to be compiled in standard format of 
University of Mumbai.  

 With the focus on the self-learning, innovation, addressing societal problems and entrepreneurship 
quality development within the students through the Mini Projects, it is preferable that a single 
project of appropriate level and quality to be carried out in two semesters by all the groups of the 
students. i.e. Mini Project 1 in semester III and IV. Similarly, Mini Project 2 in semesters V and VI.  

 However, based on the individual students or group capability, with the mentor’s recommendations, 
if the proposed Mini Project adhering to the qualitative aspects mentioned above gets completed in 
odd semester, then that group can be allowed to work on the extension of the Mini Project with 
suitable improvements/modifications or a completely new project idea in even semester. This policy 
can be adopted on case by case basis. 

Guidelines for Assessment of Mini Project: 
Term Work 

 The review/ progress monitoring committee shall be constituted by head of departments of 
each institute. The progress of mini project to be evaluated on continuous basis, minimum two 
reviews in each semester. 

 In continuous assessment focus shall also be on each individual student, assessment based on 
individual’s contribution in group activity, their understanding and response to questions. 

 Distribution of Term work marks for both semesters shall be as below; 
o Marks awarded by guide/supervisor based on log book : 10 
o Marks awarded by review committee  : 10 
o Quality of Project report  : 05 

   

Review/progress monitoring committee may consider following points for assessment 
based on either one year or half year project as mentioned in general guidelines. 
 One-year project: 

 In first semester entire theoretical solution shall be ready, including components/system 
selection and cost analysis. Two reviews will be conducted based on presentation given by 
students group. 

 First shall be for finalisation of problem   
 Second shall be on finalisation of proposed solution of problem. 

 In second semester expected work shall be procurement of component’s/systems, building of 
working prototype, testing and validation of results based on work completed in an earlier 
semester. 

 First review is based on readiness of building working prototype to be conducted. 
 Second review shall be based on poster presentation cum demonstration of working 

model in last month of the said semester.  

Half-year project: 
 In this case in one semester students’ group shall complete project in all aspects including, 

o Identification of need/problem 
o Proposed final solution 
o Procurement of components/systems 
o Building prototype and testing 

 Two reviews will be conducted for continuous assessment, 
 First shall be for finalisation of problem and proposed solution 
 Second shall be for implementation and testing of solution.

three or more than four students, as it is a group activity. 

 Students should do survey and identify needs, which shall be converted into problem statement for 
mini project in consultation with faculty supervisor/head of department/internal committee of 
faculties. 

 Students hall submit implementation plan in the form of Gantt/PERT/CPM chart, which will cover 
weekly activity of mini project. 

 A log book to be prepared by each group, wherein group can record weekly work progress, 
guide/supervisor can verify and record notes/comments.   

 Faculty supervisor may give inputs to students during mini project activity;however, focus shall be 
on self-learning.   

 Students in a group shall understand problem effectively, propose multiple solution and select best 
possible solution in consultation with guide/ supervisor. 

 



 

 Students shall convert the best solution into working model using various components of their 
domain areas and demonstrate. 

 The solution to be validated with proper justification and report to be compiled in standard format of 
University of Mumbai.  

 With the focus on the self-learning, innovation, addressing societal problems and entrepreneurship 
quality development within the students through the Mini Projects, it is preferable that a single 
project of appropriate level and quality to be carried out in two semesters by all the groups of the 
students. i.e. Mini Project 1 in semester III and IV. Similarly, Mini Project 2 in semesters V and VI.  

 However, based on the individual students or group capability, with the mentor’s recommendations, 
if the proposed Mini Project adhering to the qualitative aspects mentioned above gets completed in 
odd semester, then that group can be allowed to work on the extension of the Mini Project with 
suitable improvements/modifications or a completely new project idea in even semester. This policy 
can be adopted on case by case basis. 

Guidelines for Assessment of Mini Project:

Preamble 
 

 
To meet the challenge of ensuring excellence in engineering education, the issue of quality needs to be addressed, 
debated and taken forward in a systematic manner. Accreditation is the principal means of quality assurance in 
higher education. The major emphasis of accreditation process is to measure the outcomes of the program that is 
being accredited. In line with this Faculty of Science and Technology (in particular Engineering)of University of 
Mumbai has taken a lead in incorporating philosophy of outcome based education in the process of curriculum 
development. 
Faculty resolved that course objectives and course outcomes are to be clearly defined for each course, so that all 
faculty members in affiliated institutes understand the depth and approach of course to be taught, which will 
enhance learner’s learning process. Choice based Credit and grading system enables a much-required shift in focus 
from teacher-centric to learner-centric education since the workload estimated is based on the investment of time 
in learning and not in teaching. It also focuses on continuous evaluation which will enhance the quality of education. 
Credit assignment for courses is based on 15 weeks teaching learning process, however content of courses is to be 
taught in 13 weeks and remaining 2 weeks to be utilized for revision, guest lectures, coverage of content beyond 
syllabus etc. 
There was a concern that the earlier revised curriculum more focused on providing information and knowledge 
across various domains of the said program, which led to heavily loading of students in terms of direct contact 
hours. In this regard, faculty of science and technology resolved that to minimize the burden of contact hours, total 
credits of entire program will be of 170, wherein focus is not only on providing knowledge but also on building 
skills, attitude and self learning. Therefore in the present curriculum skill based laboratories and mini projects are 
made mandatory across all disciplines of engineering in second and third year of programs, which will definitely 
facilitate self learning of students. The overall credits and approach of curriculum proposed in the present revision 
is in line with AICTE model curriculum. 
The present curriculum will be implemented for Second Year of Engineering from the academic year 2020-21. 
Subsequently this will be carried forward for Third Year and Final Year Engineering in the academic years 2021-
22, 2022-23, respectively.

Incorporation and Implementation of Online Contents from 
NPTEL/ Swayam Platform 

 
 
 

The curriculum revision is mainly focused on knowledge component, skill based activities and project based 
activities. Self learning opportunities are provided to learners. In the revision process this time in particular 
Revised syllabus of ‘C ‘ scheme wherever possible additional resource links of platforms such as NPTEL, 
Swayam are appropriately provided. In an earlier revision of curriculum in the year 2012 and 2016 in Revised 
scheme ‘A' and ‘B' respectively, efforts were made to use online contents more appropriately as additional 
learning materials to enhance learning of students.  
In the current revision based on the recommendation of AICTE model curriculum overall credits are reduced 
to 171, to provide opportunity of self learning to learner. Learners are now getting sufficient time for self 
learning either through online courses or additional projects for enhancing their knowledge and skill sets. 
The Principals/ HoD’s/ Faculties of all the institute are required to motivate and encourage learners to use 
additional online resources available on platforms such as NPTEL/ Swayam. Learners can be advised to take 
up online courses, on successful completion they are required to submit certification for the same. This will 
definitely help learners to facilitate their enhanced learning based on their interest.

Preface By Board of Studies Team  

 
It is our honor and a privilege to present the Rev-2019 ‘C’ scheme syllabus of Bachelor of Engineering 
in Information Technology (effective from year 2019-20) with inclusion of cutting edge technology. 
Information Technology is comparatively a young branch among other engineering disciplines in the 
University of Mumbai. It is evident from the placement statistics of various colleges affiliated to the 
University of Mumbai that IT branch has taken the lead in the placement.  
 
The branch also provides multi-faceted scope like better placement and promotion of entrepreneurship 
culture among students, and increased Industry Institute Interactions. Industries views are considered 
as stakeholders will design of the syllabus of Information Technology. As per Industries views only 16 
% graduates are directly employable. One of the reasons is a syllabus which is not in line with the latest 
technologies. Our team of faculties has tried to include all the latest technologies in the syllabus. Also 
first time we are giving skill-based labs and Mini-project to students from third semester onwards 
which will help students to work on latest IT technologies. Also the first time we are giving the choice 
of elective from fifth semester such that students will be master in one of the IT domain. The syllabus 
is peer reviewed by experts from reputed industries and as per their suggestions it covers future trends 
in IT technology and research opportunities available due to these trends. 
 
We would like to thank senior faculties of IT department of all colleges affiliated to University of 
Mumbai for significant contribution in framing the syllabus. Also on behalf of all faculties we thank 
all the industry experts for their valuable feedback and suggestions. We sincerely hope that the revised 
syllabus will help all graduate engineers to face the future challenges in the field of information and 
technology 
 
 
Program Specific Outcome for graduate Program in Information Technology 
 
1. Apply Core Information Technology knowledge to develop stable and secure IT system. 
2. Design, IT infrastructures for an enterprise using concepts of best practices in information 
    Technology and security domain. 
3. Ability to work in multidisciplinary projects and make it IT enabled. 
4. Ability to adapt latest trends and technologies like Analytics, Blockchain, Cloud, Data science.

Preamble 

 
 
To meet the challenge of ensuring excellence in engineering education, the issue of quality needs to be 
addressed, debated and taken forward in a systematic manner. Accreditation is the principal means of 
quality assurance in higher education. The major emphasis of accreditation process is to measure the 
outcomes of the program that is being accredited. In line with this Faculty of Science and Technology (in 
particular Engineering)of University of Mumbai has taken a lead in incorporating philosophy of outcome 
based education in the process of curriculum development. 
Faculty resolved that course objectives and course outcomes are to be clearly defined for each course, so 
that all faculty members in affiliated institutes understand the depth and approach of course to be taught, 
which will enhance learner‘s learning process. Choice based Credit and grading system enables a much-
required shift in focus from teacher-centric to learner-centric education since the workload estimated is 
based on the investment of time in learning and not in teaching. It also focuses on continuous evaluation 
which will enhance the quality of education. Credit assignment for courses is based on 15 weeks teaching 
learning process, however content of courses is to be taught in 13 weeks and remaining 2 weeks to be 
utilized for revision, guest lectures, coverage of content beyond syllabus etc. 
There was a concern that the earlier revised curriculum more focused on providing information and 
knowledge across various domains of the said program, which led to heavily loading of students in terms 
of direct contact hours. In this regard, faculty of science and technology resolved that to minimize the 
burden of contact hours, total credits of entire program will be of 170, wherein focus is not only on 
providing knowledge but also on building skills, attitude and self learning. Therefore in the present 
curriculum skill based laboratories and mini projects are made mandatory across all disciplines of 
engineering in second and third year of programs, which will definitely facilitate self learning of students. 
The overall credits and approach of curriculum proposed in the present revision is in line with AICTE 
model curriculum. 
The present curriculum will be implemented for Second Year of Engineering from the academic year 
2020-21. Subsequently this will be carried forward for Third Year and Final Year Engineering in the 
academic years 2021-22, 2022-23, respectively.

Incorporation and Implementation of Online Contents from NPTEL/ 
Swayam Platform 

 
 
 

The curriculum revision is mainly focused on knowledge component, skill based activities and project based 
activities. Self learning opportunities are provided to learners. In the revision process this time in particular 
Revised syllabus of ‗C ‗ scheme wherever possible additional resource links of platforms such as NPTEL, 
Swayam are appropriately provided. In an earlier revision of curriculum in the year 2012 and 2016 in 
Revised scheme ‗A' and ‗B' respectively, efforts were made to use online contents more appropriately as 
additional learning materials to enhance learning of students.  
In the current revision based on the recommendation of AICTE model curriculum overall credits are 
reduced to 171, to provide opportunity of self learning to learner. Learners are now getting sufficient time 
for self learning either through online courses or additional projects for enhancing their knowledge and skill 
sets. 
The Principals/ HoD‘s/ Faculties of all the institute are required to motivate and encourage learners to use 
additional online resources available on platforms such as NPTEL/ Swayam. Learners can be advised to 
take up online courses, on successful completion they are required to submit certification for the same. This 
will definitely help learners to facilitate their enhanced learning based on their interest.

Preface By Board of Studies Team 
 

It is our honor and a privilege to present the Rev-2019 ‗C‘ scheme syllabus of Bachelor of 
Engineering in InformationTechnology (effective from year 2019-20) with inclusion of cutting edge 
technology.Information Technology is comparatively a young branch among other engineering 
disciplines in the Universityof Mumbai. It is evident from the placement statistics of various colleges 
affiliated to the University of Mumbaithat IT branch has taken the lead in the placement.  
 
The branch also provides multi-faceted scope like betterplacement and promotion of 
entrepreneurship culture among students, and increased Industry InstituteInteractions.Industries 
views are considered as stakeholders will design of the syllabus of Information Technology. As per 
Industries views only 16 % graduates are directly employable. One of the reasons is a syllabus which 
isnot in line with the latest technologies. Our team of faculties has tried to include all the latest 
technologies in thesyllabus. Also first time we are giving skill-based labs and Mini-project to 
students from third semester onwards which will help students to work on latest IT technologies. 
Also the first time we are giving the choice of elective from fifth semester such that students will 
bemaster in one of the IT domain.The syllabus is peer reviewed by experts from reputed industries 
and as per their suggestions it covers futuretrends in IT technology and research opportunities 
available due to these trends. 
 
We would like to thank senior faculties of IT department of all colleges affiliated to University of 
Mumbai forsignificant contribution in framing the syllabus. Also on behalf of all faculties we thank 
all the industry experts fortheir valuable feedback and suggestions. We sincerely hope that the 
revised syllabus will help all graduate engineers to face the future challenges in thefield of 
information and technology 
 
 
Program Specific Outcome for graduate Program in Information Technology 
 
1. ApplyCore Information Technology knowledge to develop stable and secure IT system. 
2. Design, IT infrastructures for an enterprise using concepts of best practices in information 
Technology and security domain. 
3. Ability to work in multidisciplinary projects and make it IT enabled.
