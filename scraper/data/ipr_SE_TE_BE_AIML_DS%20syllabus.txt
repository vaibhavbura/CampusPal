Syllabus for Approval 
Preamble 
 
To meet the challenge of ensuring excellence in engineering education, the issue of quality needs to 
be addressed, debated and taken forward in a systematic  manner. Accreditation is the principal 
means of quality assurance in higher education. The major emphasis of accreditation process is to 
measure the outcomes of the program that is being accredited. In line with this Faculty of Science 
and Technology (in particular Engineering)of University of Mumbai has taken a lead in 
incorporating philosophy of outcome based education in the process of curriculum development. 
Faculty resolved that course objectives and course outcomes are to be clearly defined for each 
course, so that all faculty members in affiliated institutes understand the depth and approach of 
course to be taught, which will enhance learner‟s learning process. Choice based Credit and grading 
system enables a much-required shift in focus from teacher -centric to learner-centric education since 
the workload estimated is based on the investment of time in learning and not in teaching. It also 
focuses on continuous evaluation which will enhance the quality of education. Credit assignment for 
courses is based on 15 weeks teaching learning process, however content of courses is to be taught in 
13 weeks and remaining 2 weeks to be utilized for revision, guest lectures, coverage of content 
beyond syllabus etc. 
There was a concern that the earlier revised curri culum more focused on providing information and 
knowledge across various domains of the said program, which led to heavily loading of students in 
terms of direct contact hours. In this regard, faculty of science and technology resolved that to 
minimize the burden of contact hours, total credits of entire program will be of 170, wherein focus is 
not only on providing knowledge but also on building skills, attitude and self learning. Therefore in 
the present curriculum skill based laboratories and mini projec ts are made mandatory across all 
disciplines of engineering in second and third year of programs, which will definitely facilitate self 
learning of students. The overall credits and approach of curriculum proposed in the present revision 
is in line with AICTE model curriculum. 
The present curriculum will be implemented for Second Year of Engineering from the academic year 
2021-22. Subsequently this will be carried forward for Third Year and Final Year Engine ering in the 
academic years 2022-23, 2023-24, respectively.

Incorporation and Implementation of Online Contents from 
NPTEL/ Swayam Platform 
 
 
 
The curriculum revision is mainly focused on knowledge component, skill based activities and 
project based activities. Self learning opportunities are provided to learners. In the revision 
process this time in particular Revised s yllabus of „C „ scheme wherever possible additional 
resource links of platforms such as NPTEL, Swayam are appropriately provided. In an earlier 
revision of curriculum in the year 2012 and 2016 in Revised scheme „A' and „B' respectively, 
efforts were made t o use online contents more appropriately as additional learning materials to 
enhance learning of students. 
In the current revision based on the recommendation of AICTE model curriculum overall credits 
are reduced to 171, to provide opportunity of self lear ning to learner. Learners are now getting 
sufficient time for self learning either through online courses or additional projects for enhancing 
their knowledge and skill sets. 
The Principals/ HoD‟s/ Faculties of all the institute are required to motivate an d encourage 
learners to use additional online resources available on platforms such as NPTEL/ Swayam. 
Learners can be advised to take up online courses, on successful completion they are required to 
submit certification for the same. This will definitely h elp learners to facilitate their enhanced 
learning based on their interest.

Guidelines for Mini Project 
1 Students shall form a group of 3 to 4 students, while forming a group shall not be allowed 
less than three or more than four students, as it is a group activity. 
2 Students should  do survey and identify needs, which shall be converted into problem 
statement for mini project in consultation with faculty supervisor/head of 
department/internal committee of faculties. 
3 Students shall submit implementation plan in the form of Gantt/PERT/CPM chart, which 
will cover weekly activity of mini project. 
4 A logbook to be prepared by each group, wherein group can record weekly work progress, 
guide/supervisor can verify and record notes/comments. 
5 Faculty supervisor may give inputs to students during mini project activity; however, focus 
shall be on self-learning. 
6 Students in a group shall understand problem effectively, propose multiple solution and 
select best possible solution in consultation with guide/ supervisor. 
7 Students shall convert the best solution into working model using various components of 
their domain areas and demonstrate. 
8 The solution to be validated with proper justification and report to be compiled in standard 
format of University of Mumbai. 
9 With the focus on the self -learning, innovation, addressing societal problems and 
entrepreneurship quality development within the students through the Mini Projects, it is 
preferable that a single project of appropriate level and quality to be carried out in two 
semesters by all the groups of the students. i.e. Mini Project 1 in semester III and IV. 
Similarly, Mini Project 2 in semesters V and VI. 
10 However, based on the individual students or group capability, with the mentor‟s 
recommendations, if the proposed Mini Project adhering to the qualitative aspects 
mentioned above gets completed in odd semester, then that group can be allowed to work 
on the extension of the Mini Project with suitable improvements/modifications or a 
completely new project idea in even semester. This policy can be adopted on case by case 
basis. 
Term Work 
The review/ progress monitoring committee shall be constituted by head of departments of each 
institute. The progress of mini project to be evaluated on continuous basis, minimum two 
reviews in each semester. 
In continuous assessment focus shall also be on each individual student, assessment based on 
individual‟s contribution in group activity, their understanding and response to questions.

Preamble 
 
To meet the challenge of ensuring excellence in engineering education, the issue of quality needs to 
be addressed, debated and taken forward in a systematic manner. Accreditation is the principal 
means of quality assurance in higher education. The major emphasis of accreditation process is to 
measure the outcomes of the program that is being accredited. In line with this Faculty of Science 
and Technology (in particular Engineering) of University of Mumbai has taken a lead in 
incorporating philosophy of outcome based education in the process of curriculum development. 
Faculty resolved that course objectives and course outcomes are to be clearly defined for each 
course, so that all faculty members in affiliated institutes understand the depth and approach of 
course to be taught, which will enhance learner‘s learning process. Choice based Credit and grading 
system enables a much-required shift in focus from teacher -centric to learner-centric education since 
the workload estimated is based on the investment of time in l earning and not in teaching. It also 
focuses on continuous evaluation which will enhance the quality of education. Credit assignment for 
courses is based on 15 weeks teaching learning process, however content of courses is to be taught in 
13 weeks and rema ining 2 weeks to be utilized for revision, guest lectures, coverage of content 
beyond syllabus etc. 
There was a concern that the earlier revised curriculum more focused on providing information and 
knowledge across various domains of the said program, whic h led to heavily loading of students in 
terms of direct contact hours. In this regard, faculty of science and technology resolved that to 
minimize the burden of contact hours, total credits of entire program will be of 170, wherein focus is 
not only on pro viding knowledge but also on building skills, attitude and self learning. Therefore in 
the present curriculum skill based laboratories and mini projects are made mandatory across all 
disciplines of engineering in second and third year of programs, which wi ll definitely facilitate self 
learning of students. The overall credits and approach of curriculum proposed in the present revision 
is in line with AICTE model curriculum. 
The present curriculum will be implemented for Second Year of Engineering from the academic year 
2021-22. Subsequently this will be carried forward for Third Year and Final Year Engineering in the 
academic years 2022-23, 2023-24, respectively.

Incorporation and Implementation of Online Contents 
fromNPTEL/ Swayam Platform 
 
 
 
 The curriculum revision is mainly focused on knowledge component, skill based activities 
and project based activities. Self learning opportunities are provided to learners. In the revision 
process this time in particular Revised syllabus of ‗C‘ scheme wherever possible additional 
resource links of platforms such as NPTEL, Swayam are appropriately pro vided. In an earlier 
revision of curriculum in the year 2012 and 2016 in Revised scheme ‗A' and ‗B' respectively, 
efforts were made to use online contents more appropriately as additional learning materials to 
enhance learning of students. 
In the current revision based on the recommendation of AICTE model curriculum overall credits 
are reduced to 171, to provide opportunity of self learning to learner. Learners are now getting 
sufficient time for self learning either through online courses or additional projects for enhancing 
their knowledge and skill sets. 
The Principals/ HoD‘s/ Faculties of all the institute are required to motivate and encourage 
learners to use additional online resources available on platforms such as NPTEL/ Swayam. 
Learners can be advised to take up online courses, on successful completion they are required to 
submit certification for the same. This will definitely help learners to facilitate their enhanced 
learning based on their interest.

Guidelines for Mini Project 
1 Mini project may be carried out in one or more form of following:  
Product preparations, prototype development model, fabrication of set -ups, laboratory 
experiment  development, process modification/development, simulation, software 
development, integr ation of  software (frontend -backend) and hardware, statistical 
data analysis, creating awareness in society/environment  etc.  
2 Students shall form a group of 3 to 4 students, while forming a group shall not be 
allowed less than three or more than four students, as it is a group activity. 
3 Students should do survey and identify needs, which shall be converted into problem 
statement for mini project in consultation with faculty supervisor or 
head of department/internal committee of faculties. 
4 Students shall submit an implementation plan in the form of Gantt/PERT/CPM chart, 
which will cover weekly activity of mini projects. 
5 A logbook may be prepared by each group, wherein the group can record weekly work 
progress, guide/supervisor can verify and record notes/comments. 
6 Faculty supervisors may give inputs to students during mini project activity; however, 
focus shall be on self-learning. 
7 Students under the guidance of faculty supervisor shall convert the best solution into a 
working model using various components of their domain areas and demonstrate. 
8 The solution to be validated with proper justification and report to be compiled in 
standard format of University of Mumbai. Software requirement specification (SRS) 
documents, research papers, competition certificates may be submitted as part of 
annexure to the report. 
9 With the focus on self -learning, innovation, addressing societal/research/innovation 
problems and entrepreneurship quality development within the students through the 
Mini Projects, it is preferable that a single project of appropriate level and quality be 
carried out in two semesters by all the groups of the students. i.e. Mini Project 2 in 
semesters V and VI. 
10 However, based on the individual students or group capability, wit h the mentor‘s 
recommendations, if   the   proposed   Mini Project adhering to the qualitative aspects 
mentioned above, gets completed in odd semester, then that group can be allowed to 
work on the extension of the Mini Project with suitable improvements/m odifications or 
a completely new project idea in even semester. This policy can be adopted on a case 
by case basis. 
 
Term Work 
The review/ progress monitoring committee shall be constituted by the heads of departments of 
each institute. The progress of the mini project to be evaluated on a continuous basis, based on 
the SRS document submitted. minimum two reviews in each semester. 
In continuous assessment focus shall also be on each individual student, assessment based on 
individual‘s contribution in group activity, their understanding and response to questions.

Preamble 
 
To meet the challenge of ensuring excellence in engineering education, the issue of quality needs to be 
addressed, debated and taken forward in a  systematic manner. Accreditation is the principal means  of 
quality assurance in higher education. The major emphasis of accreditation process is to measure  the 
outcomes of the program that is being accredited. In line with this Faculty of Science and Technology 
(in particular Engineering) of University of Mumbai has taken a lead in incorporating  philosophy of 
outcome based education in the process of curriculum development. 
Faculty resolved that course objectives and course outcomes are to be clearly defined for each course, 
so that all faculty members in affiliated institutes understand the depth and approach of course to be  
taught, which will enhance learner’s learning process. Choice based Credit and grading system enables 
a much-required shift in focus from teacher -centric to learner -centric education since the workload  
estimated is based on the investment of time in learning and not in teaching. It also focuses on  
continuous evaluation which will enhance the quality of education. Credit ass ignment for courses is  
based on 15 weeks teaching learning process, however content of courses is to be taught in 13 weeks  
and remaining 2 weeks to be utilized for revision, guest lectures, coverage of content beyond syllabus 
etc. 
There was a concern that the earlier revised curriculum more focused on providing information and  
knowledge across various domains of the said program, which led to heavily loading of students in  
terms of direct contact hours. In this regard, faculty of science and technology resolved that to minimize 
the burden of contact hours, total credits of entire program will be of 170, wherein focus is not only on 
providing knowledge but also on building skills, attitude and self learning. Therefore in  the present 
curriculum skill based laboratories and mini projects are made mandatory across all  disciplines of 
engineering in second and third year of programs, which will definitely facilitate self  learning of 
students. The overall credits and approach of curriculum proposed in the present revision is in line with 
AICTE model curriculum. 
The present curriculum will be implemented for Second Year of Engineering from the academic year 
2021-22. Subsequently this will be carried forward for Third Year and Final Year Engineering in the  
academic years 2022-23, 2023-24, respectively.

Incorporation and Implementation of Online Contents 
fromNPTEL/ Swayam Platform 
 
 
 
 
The curriculum revision is mainly focused on knowledge component, skill based activities  
and project based activities. Self learning opportunities are provided to learners. In the revision  
process this time in particular Revised syllabus of ‘C’ scheme wherever possible additional  
resource links of platforms such as NPTEL, Swayam are appropriately provided. In an earlier  
revision of curriculum in the year 2012 and 2016 in Revised scheme ‘A' and ‘B' respectively,  
efforts were made to use online contents more appropriately as additional learning materials to  
enhance learning of students. 
In the current revision based on the recommendation of AICTE model curriculum overall cre dits 
are reduced to 171, to provide opportunity of self learning to learner. Learners are now getting  
sufficient time for self learning either through online courses or additional projects for enhancing  
their knowledge and skill sets. 
The Principals/ HoD’s/ Faculties of all the institute are required to motivate and encourage learners 
to use additional online resources available on platforms such as NPTEL/ Swayam. Learners can  
be advised to take up online courses, on successful completion they are required to submit  
certification for the same. This will definitely help learners to facilitate their enhanced learning  
based on their interest.
