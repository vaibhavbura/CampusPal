 The main objective of this is to promote IT literacy for education and improve the 
employment potential of learners in India, using FOSS (free and open source software). 
ICT is an important area that provides jobs to a large number of our students. Software 
creation, electronic design automation (IC design), numerical computing, and modelling 
and simulation are some of the ICT areas. We aim to pass on the knowledge of technology 
and free and open source software (FOSS) through the website to the millions in our 
country, who lack opportunities and/or access to learn any software. 
 
 A wide range of training cum certification programmes are organized by the 
APSIT center 
for students of all semesters. Around 186 students got certified in 2018-2019 in various 
programming languages and tools including Java, Linux, Python,Arduino and LaTeX.

premises for Mechanical Engineering Students to introduce about software tools 
advancement.
