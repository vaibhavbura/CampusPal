Manuual for Honours and Minor Degree Programs in Engineering  
   

1. Introduction:    

As per the AICTE’s Approval Process Handbook-2020-21: Chapter VII- clause 7.3.2 (Page 99-101), all 
branches of Engineering and Technology shall offer Elective Courses in the EMERGING AREAS viz., 
Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Blockchain, Robotics, Quantum Computing, Data 
Sciences, Cyber Security, 3D Printing and Design, Augmented Reality/ Virtual Reality (AR/VR), as 
specified in Annexure 1 of the Approval Process Handbook.    

a) Under Graduate Degree Courses in EMERGING AREAS shall be allowed as specialization from the 
same Department. The minimum additional Credits for such Courses shall be in the range of 18-
20 and the same shall be mentioned in the degree, as specialization in that particular area. For 
example, doing extra credits for Robotics in Mechanical Engineering shall earn B.E./ B.Tech. 
(Honours.) Mechanical Engineering with specialization in Robotics   

b) Minor specialization in EMERGING AREAS in Under Graduate Degree Courses may be allowed 
where a student of another Department shall take the minimum additional Credits in the range 
of 18-20 and get a degree with minor from another Department.   

It is also made very clear by AICTE that areas in which Minor Degree/Honours may be offered are 
numerous. It is up to the Universities with the help of their Academic Board/Council to decide whether 
Minor Degree/Honours. is to be offered or not in any particular area, which is not mentioned above. 
AICTE approval is not required for offering Minor Degree/Honours. in any such area, however the 
criteria that “Minor Degree or Honours. will cumulatively require additional 18 to 20 credits in the 
specified area in addition to the credits essential for obtaining the Under Graduate Degree in Major 
Discipline (i.e. 160 credits)”   

2. Proposed Honours and Minor Degree:   

Honours and Minor degree program is introduced in order to facilitate the students to choose 
additionally the specialized courses in the emerging areas of their choice and build their competence in 
such domains. Based on AICTE guidelines, the Faculty of Science and Technology has proposed to offer

declaration are entirely done by University, while as in Second and Third Year question papers are 
delivered by University, assessment and results preparation and declaration after approval from 
university is done by Institute on behalf of University following all ordinances and regulations of 
university. Honours/Minor degrees courses will be offered in Third and Final Year of engineering as 
specialisation in emerging areas.    

By keeping in mind availability of expertise of faculty with particular Institute only, proposed following 
modalities of Examination and Evaluation,    

Internal Assessment Examination: 

1. Two Internal Assessment (IA) tests shall be carried out at institute level for each subject of Honours 
/ Minor programs as per the directives given in the scheme and the syllabus. 

End Semester Examination: 

1. Question papers of End Semester Examination for each subject shall be prepared by the paper 
setter panel appointed by University of Mumbai. 

2. End Semester Examination answer-books evaluation (for sem. V, sem. VI, sem. VII and sem. VIII) of 
subjects offered at each Honours / Minor programs shall be carried out by respective institute at 
institute level by the examiners appointed by Principal from the panel provided by University. 

3. Moderation-moderation of the answer books shall be carried out as per the existing rules 
applicable as per ordinance O.5046-A to the regular examination by the moderator appointed by 
Principal from the panel provided by the university. 

4. Revaluation- Revaluation of the answer books shall be carried out as per the existing rules 
applicable to the regular examination by the examiners appointed by Principal 

5. Each institute shall process the result applying ordinance O.5042-A and prepare the gazette copy 
of the results for respective semester for each Honours / Minor programs offered.  Institutes shall 
submit results for moderation and approval to University similar to process of semester II to VI. 
Institute shall maintain the record of each student for each of the Honours / Minor programs 
offered till the completion of the Sem VIII end sem. examination.  

6. University shall create portal for getting all marks and status of students results of Honours/Minor 
Programs. University shall issue common grade sheet of Honours/Minors Programs after the 
successful completion of all semesters including 8th semester (final semester of their regular 
program). 

7. If the students compeletes the Honours / Minor program but fails in Sem VII / VIII, he/ she will not 
get any degree at that point of time, but both after passing regular degree program and Honours/ 
Minor program. However, the Honours/ Minor program should be completed in four semesters 
only.

Rationale 
 

Geographic information system (GIS) is a computer system for capturing, storing, checking, and displaying data 
related to positions on Earth's surface. By relating seemingly unrelated data, GIS can help individuals and 
organizations better understand spatial patterns and relationships. IS technology is a crucial part of spatial 
data infra-structure. Many different types of information can be compared and contrasted using GIS. The system 
can include data about people, such as population, income, or education level. It can include information about 
the landscape, such as the location of streams, different kinds of vegetation, and different kinds of soil. It can 
include information about the sites of factories, farms, and schools, or storm drains, roads, and electric power 
lines. Use of Geographic’s Information system in all infrastructures will enhance the social, economic, 
development of India in all aspects.

Rationale 

Today, more than 54% of the world’s total population lives in urban areas. It is projected that urbanization 
will continue in the coming years, raising the urban population to 6.0 billion people by 2045. The significant 
increase in urban population will put awesome load on urban infrastructure which results in increasing the 
demand for energy, mobility, water, and other urban services in cities. So, cities have to become smarter in 
provision of urban services. Also due to the global awareness about negative environmental impacts of 
pollution, cities are feeling more pressure to improve their environmental performance, while improving 
their level of services. Increasing demand for sustainable, inclusive, reliable and efficient urban service puts 
our urban infrastructures under a huge pressure. But digitalization provides a powerful tool to address these 
issues and create a paradigm shift in our concept of cities. Due to this novel nature of smart cities, it is 
important that policymakers, urban managers and other relevant actors be prepared to understand and 
address the challenges that the transition will bring about. This course will provide the basic principles that 
to consider for a successful transition into a smart city. 

Objectives 

1. Enable students in understanding the concepts, discourses and practices of “Smart Cities” 
across the Globe. 

2. To develop competence in planning projects at the city level to ensure sustainability of 
environment and human beings. 

3. Apply smart technologies across the spectrum of infrastructure and governance. 
 

4. Develop overall city strategy to become contemporary and competitive. 
5. Enable students to understand city centric capital formation and finance, risk and feasibility to 

ensure the economic health of the city. 
6. Develop overall smart cities and villages.

Rationale 

Smart City projects involve great technical complexity, and require a wide diversity of skills to control and 
monitor them. Project Management would be an integral part for smart infrastructure and cities. Like other 
complex infrastructure projects; smart city projects are subjected to risk and uncertainties leading to huge time 
and cost overrun. Managers are faced with the problem of putting together and directing large temporary 
organizations subjected to constrained resources, limited time, and environmental uncertainty. Project 
management plays an important role in developing the Smart Cities. It has grown in response to the need for a 
managerial approach that deals with the problems and opportunities of modern society. It provides the technical 
and managerial competency, communication and decision making necessary to meet the challenges of complex 
activities. Application of modern project management tools would ensure more collaboration, communication 
flow and much flawless implementation of Smart City projects. Modern project management concepts of 
application of Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) and Building Information Modeling (BIM) would reduce the co-
ordination problems and ensure much higher probability of successful completion of the projects within 
stipulated time and cost frame 

 

Objectives 
 

1. This course is designed to give exposure to project management tools and techniques applicable for 
planning, controlling and monitoring of Smart Infrastructure and Cities. 

2. This course would also enable to develop insight for managing project risks, uncertainties and 
complexities of smart city projects. 

3. To provide overview on sound disaster risk management practices for preparing towards “Safe Cities”. 
To educate and sensitize students, government officers, planners, policy makers, academician, 
researchers and others on process of disaster management in smart cities.  

4. To educate participants on various tools and methods that can be adopted for hazard identification, 
vulnerability analysis and disaster risk reduction measures.  

5. To stimulate thought process to address hazard risks and vulnerabilities of distinct groups within the 
city to make more resilient communities.  

6. To stimulate process of critically analyzing risks to various urban sectors like Health, Transport, 
Communication, Housing, Services, Infrastructure etc to come up with strategy to reduce risks

Rationale 

The smart city infrastructure is the introductory step for establishing the overall smart city framework and 
architecture. The scope of these cities is mainly limited to construct a technology park converting the industrial 
real estate to state-of-the-art information technology using the evolution in the telecom and IP networks including 
insignificant asset management automation system. Urbanization is not only associated with economic 
development but over the time it started aspiring people to better quality of life. Cities are seen as solutions for 
boosting economy, generating employment, creating skills, providing better health services and many more 
things. However, the state of urban service delivery in India’s cities and towns is far poorer than is desirable for 
India’s current income levels. Considering that the Indian economy has been one of the fastest growing economies 
in the world for some time, and aspirations and standards are raising, the current state of service delivery is simply 
unacceptable. Moreover, a successful city cannot operate efficiently in isolation from its environment. It must 
balance social, economic and environmental needs. Smart Cities focus on their most pressing needs and on the 
greatest opportunities to improve lives. They tap a range of approaches – digital and information technologies, 
urban planning best practices, public private partnerships, and policy change to make a difference. 

Objectives 

1. To study application of Solar Energy for Smart Cities-Conventional vs. Smart City 
2. To prepare the qualified resource persons for the upcoming specialization in solid waste management 

practices after the mission period of SBM i.e., after 2020. 
3. To learn from the challenges and limitations faced in e-governance projects in Citizen Services delivery, 

industries and commerce and intra-government systems for efficiency and transparency.  
4. To develop ability to conceptualize, design, implement and manage the new era smart e-governance 

projects. 
5. An understanding of the urban water supply and sanitation systems and linkages with urban forms.  
6. Understanding the fundamentals of large project financing-Financial markets for smart city project finance 

such as syndicated bank loans, capital markets, private equity fund, multilateral institutions, joint ventures, 
public-private-partnership (PPP)  

7. Understanding the projects and their business risks.  
8. Understanding the documentation used to structure individual large project financings.

Rationale Rationale 

Smart City projects involve great technical complexity. It requires a widespread diversity of skills to control and 
monitor them. For any smart infrastructure project management would be an integral part. Like other complex 
infrastructure projects; smart city projects are subjected to risk and uncertainties leading to huge time and 
cost overrun. Project managers are faced with many problems that are putting together subjected to 
constrained resources, finance, time, and environmental uncertainty. Therefore, project management plays an 
important role in the development of the Smart Cities. It provides the technical and managerial competency, 
communication and decision making necessary to meet the challenges of complex activities. It has grown in 
response to the need for a managerial approach that deals with the problems and opportunities of modern 
society. A successful city operates efficiently only when it balances social, economic and environmental needs. 
Smart Cities focus on their most demanding needs to improve lives. They tap various approaches like digital 
and information technologies, urban planning best practices, public private partnerships, capacity building, 
policy change to achieve the success.

Rationale 

The introduction of Smart urban technologies into legacy infrastructures has resulted in numerous challenges 
and opportunities for contemporary cities and will continue to do so. Over the past few years, advances in the 
Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have significantly challenged the traditionally stable 
landscape of urban infrastructure service provision. This has resulted in increasing interest from both 
technology vendors and public authorities in the transition of cities towards so-called “Smart Cities”. Although 
such “Smart technologies” can provide immense opportunities for citizens and service providers alike, the ICTs 
often act as disruptive innovators of urban infrastructure service provision. 

Objectives 

 

1. Enable students to develop competence in planning of projects at the city level to ensure sustainability 
of environment and humans 

2. Enable students to apply smart technologies across the spectrum of infrastructure and governance 
 

3. Enable students to develop overall city strategy to become contemporary and competitive 

4. Enable students to understand city centric capital formation and finance, risk and feasibility to ensure 
the economic health of the city

Rationale 

Land law is important in relation with the Infrastructure Engineering students. This will familiarize the students with 
the acts and codes that are applicable as per actual conditions in the field. The course deals with the overall knowledge 
of the central and state acts and rules. Land law is the form of law that deals with the rights to use, alienate, or exclude 
others from land. In many jurisdictions, these kinds of property are referred to as real estate or real property, as distinct 
from personal property. Land use agreements, including renting, are an important intersection of property and 
contract law. Civil and Infrastructural Engineers need to have a working knowledge of the land laws that affect their 
work and that will enable them to comply with local, state & national regulations; understand the boundaries of their 
personal and professional liability; negotiate contracts; protect their intellectual property; develop a relationship with 
a law firm that understands the engineering business.
