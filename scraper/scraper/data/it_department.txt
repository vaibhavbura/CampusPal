Moodle is an E-learning management system
at APSIT where Faculties upload course material and assignments. Students can access these course contents form their mobile at any time and from anywhere. Resources uploaded by faculties on Moodle not only caters our all requirements for university examinations but also helps us enhancing in depth technical knowledge of subjects which is quite helpful for technical interviews. Question banks and Online Tests created faculties for core subjects plays an important role in preparing for higher study examinations like GATE.

Project Based Learning:
The Project-Based Learning  is an intensive training session which lets us have a hands-on experience while learning. It is quite different from the classroom environment and encourage us to work together in teams. We are trained for recent technologies by industry experts. These activities are usually conducted in summer / winter vacation for duration of a week. Department has developed dedicated labs of sufficient capacity for these trainings so that trainings can be conducted for entire class at one go. We, as a student need to complete the assigned project under the guidance of internal faculty and is reviewed by trainer at regular intervals. These trainings put no additional financial burden on us since its provided free of cost.

Technical Training's & Events:
As an IT student workshops & STTPs arranged by Department provided me with a wide arena of the field and thus allowed me learn something new at every semester. What amazes me is the plethora of technical activities that the Department offers without putting any extra financial burden & hence compelling individuals to explore and pursue extra talents while inculcating the spirit to stand out amongst the talented hardworking students. High quality and comprehensive training events not only helps us to strengthen the knowledge but also ensures development of technical as well as interpersonal skills.

Advanced Teaching Methodologies:
Besides taking various initiative for us , college adopted advance teaching methodologies since its establishment. To enhance the student’s participation, interaction, learning in academic activities faculties take an aid of touch interactive projection systems deployed in classrooms. I feel the smart classrooms allow us to learn with visual aids in an independent as well as collaborative manner.
